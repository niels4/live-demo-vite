# Live Demo - Vite

This project is an example of how I would set up a Typescript React application in a professional environment.

- Typescript for typechecking
- Eslint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- Vitest for unit testing
- Can run the same tests in JsDOM or in browser mode
- A simple router with tests with 100% code coverage
- Uses [websocket-text-relay](https://github.com/niels4/websocket-text-relay) to automatically hot reload the UI as you type

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

## TODO

This project is not complete. I still need to:

- Add more page examples and documentation on how to create new routes.
- Add documentation explaining how to use the websocket-text-relay plugin with your text editor
